## About Beginners

These questions are easy to solve for most of starting programmers or atleast gives them the flavor they need for competitive programming.

Beginner programs revise you from the basics of i/o to mathematical problems that will be needed as your step forward in competitive programming.

## Problems Solved: 

1. Life, Universe and Everything
2. ATM
3. Enormous Input Test
4. Factorial
5. Small Factorial (C++ Version isn't solved yet, I have completed the solution in Java)
6. Turbo Sort
7. Lead Game
8. Packaging Cupcakes
9. Sums in a Triangle
10. Ambigious Permutation
11. Ciel and Receipt
12. Transform and Expression
13. Cutting Recipes
14. Add Two Numbers
15. Snape and Ladder
16. Chef and Remissness
17. Sums of Digits
18. Find Remainder
19. Lucky Four
20. Three Way Communication
21. First and Last Digit
22. Number Mirror
23. Reverse the Number

## Solving Problems

A solution can be solved in many ways, look for a one with minimum time and space complexity of trade off when necessary. Mastering of basic algorithms, greedy approach, dynamic programming etc and STL is a must for competitive programming.

Note: You should save time when necessary
