## About Beginners

These questions are easy to solve for most of starting programmers or atleast gives them the flavor they need for competitive programming.

Beginner programs revise you from the basics of i/o to mathematical problems that will be needed as your step forward in competitive programming.

## Solving Problems

A solution can be solved in many ways, look for a one with minimum time and space complexity or trade off when necessary. Mastering of basic algorithms, greedy approach, dynamic programming etc and STL is a must for competitive programming.

Note: You should save time when necessary, and avoid from TLE
